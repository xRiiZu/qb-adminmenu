# QB-AdminMenu
I just took the menu from the qb-core framework and reworked it with a lot more options to help moderate the server from a simple menu. Some of the additional options I have added are below
# Options
1. Self Options
    - Add Armor
    - Vehicle Godmode
    - Change ped model
    - Infinite Ammo
    - Max Ammo
2. Player Options
    - Add Money
    - Set Money
    - Give Item
    - Play sound
    - View food, water, stress, and armor in %
    - View Crafting and Dealer Rep
    - View Cash and Bank Balance
    - View Current gang


# Dependencies
[qb-menu] and [qb-input]
